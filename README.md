# Wayfinding - Interactive SVG Map

My goal of this project was to implement from scratch Graph data structure and Dijkstra algorithm in Typescript.

To visualize how it's working, you can find shortest path on map of shop to product you're searching for from different starting points.

Technology stack: `React` `Typescript`
